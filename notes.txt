How to get PHP to upload large files...

PHP won't accept you setting any of the filesize params in php.ini over 2048 MB, it's basically broken

set in PHP.ini:

max_execution_time = 600     ; Maximum execution time of each script, in seconds
max_input_time = 600	; Maximum amount of time each script may spend parsing request data
memory_limit = 500M      ; Maximum amount of memory a script may consume (16MB)
upload_max_filesize = 1024M
post_max_size = 1024M

Because PHP uses 32-bit signed integers it can only store a max value of 2147483647 which if converted to GB = around 1.9 GB.
